# Archiving 

    The possibility to encode and decode collections of objects, standard or custom, allows
    us to store the entire model of our app in files using archiving. In this example, we 
    are going to build a small application to insert names in the model and list them in a
    table. The names are going to be managed by a model that archives all the values and
    stores them in a file for future reference, so every time the app is launched, the 
    values in the model are recovered from the file.

## Archiving the model’s data

## Displaying the model’s data

## Adding and updating the model’s values
